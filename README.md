# Storyteller Skills Plugin

Portable [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) plugin from **Storyteller Tactics** (Pip Decks) by Steve Rawling.

**Front door:** `storyteller-start` — diagnoses your goal, routes to a recipe, drafts a story brief.  
**Recipes:** `stories-that-sell` · `motivate` · `convince` · `connect` · `explain` · `lead` · `impress`  
**Reference:** `storyteller-tactics` — arcs, cards, glossary (not the starting skill for vague asks)

Every recipe is **draft-first**: filled brief + `TBD`s, then you react — not a blank questionnaire. Each recipe ships a **fictional exemplar** so agents match density and shape (not the fake facts).

## Install (npm)

```bash
npm install storyteller-skills
```

Install hooks (`postinstall` / `prepare`) symlink all 9 skills into the project’s agent dirs:

- `.cursor/skills/`
- `.claude/skills/`
- `.codex/skills/`
- `.agents/skills/`

If hooks were skipped (some npm configs use `--ignore-scripts`), run:

```bash
npx storyteller-skills
# or
npm run sync --prefix node_modules/storyteller-skills
```

Globals (`~/.cursor/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, …):

```bash
npx storyteller-skills --global
# or
STORYTELLER_SKILLS_GLOBAL=1 npm install storyteller-skills
```

### Before the package is on the registry

```bash
# Develop / use this repo
cd storytelling-skill && npm install

# Another project — local path
npm install /path/to/storytelling-skill --foreground-scripts
npx storyteller-skills   # if links didn’t appear

# Or from GitHub (after you push)
npm install github:YOUR_USER/storytelling-skill --foreground-scripts
```

### Alternative: skills CLI (Git)

```bash
npx skills add YOUR_USER/storytelling-skill --skill '*' -y
npx skills add YOUR_USER/storytelling-skill -g --skill '*' -y
```

### Sync via skills CLI from node_modules

```bash
npm install storyteller-skills
npx skills experimental_sync -y
```

### ChatGPT

Upload folders under `skills/` (each must contain `SKILL.md`). Prefer `storyteller-start`, the recipe you need, and `storyteller-tactics`.
